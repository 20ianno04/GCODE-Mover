## Description

While trying to create a parametric vase mode gridfinity storage box i stumbled on a problem.
I needed to print the lower part of the box with traditional slicing settings, but i wanted to meke the upper part in vase mode. (I use CURA slicer)
I couldnt print the whole body in vase mode because there would be holes betwheen the bottom squares. 
So i tried to slice the upper part in vase mode and offset it in the slicer, but this ended up in missing base layers and an incorrect offset.
